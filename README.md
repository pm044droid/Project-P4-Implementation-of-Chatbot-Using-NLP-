# **Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot designed to understand and respond to user inputs based on predefined intents. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, a logistic regression model, and a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

## **Features**
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies user intents based on input text using a logistic regression model trained on labeled data.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the interface allows users to chat with the bot and view conversation history.
- **Customizable Dataset**: Includes a JSON file for easily adding or modifying intents, patterns, and responses.
- **Conversation Logging**: Saves user-bot interactions in a CSV file for review and analysis.
- **Extensible Design**: Can be extended with additional intents, NLP techniques, or advanced algorithms.

---

## **Technologies Used**
1. **Python**: Core language for the implementation.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - `nltk`: For tokenization and preprocessing.
   - `scikit-learn`: For feature extraction (`TfidfVectorizer`) and classification (`LogisticRegression`).
3. **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web-based chatbot interface.
4. **Data Storage**:
   - JSON: For storing intent patterns and responses.
   - CSV: For logging user-chatbot interactions.

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (`nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/chatbot-nlp.git
   cd chatbot-nlp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download NLTK data (if required):
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. Run the chatbot application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open the chatbot in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. **Home**: Start chatting with the bot by entering text in the input box.
4. **Conversation History**: View saved conversations.
5. **About**: Learn more about the project.

## **Dataset (intents.json)**
The dataset defines the chatbot’s responses based on user inputs. It contains:
- **Tag**: Category of the intent.
- **Patterns**: User input examples for each intent.
- **Responses**: Predefined bot responses for the corresponding intent.

Example:
```json
[
    {
        "tag": "greeting",
        "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "How are you?"],
        "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
    },
    {
        "tag": "goodbye",
        "patterns": ["Bye", "See you later", "Goodbye"],
        "responses": ["Goodbye!", "Take care!", "See you soon!"]
    }
]
```

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add support for advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT).
- Include named entity recognition (NER) to extract specific information.
- Incorporate sentiment analysis to adjust responses dynamically.
- Deploy the chatbot on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP).
